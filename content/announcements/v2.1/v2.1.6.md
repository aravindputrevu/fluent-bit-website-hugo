###### KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Release Notes v2.1.6

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is a Fast and Lightweight Data Processor and Forwarder for Linux,
BSD and OSX. We are proud to announce the availability of **Fluent Bit v2.1.6**.

#### Introduction

Fluent Bit v2.1 is the start of the new stable series of the project. During the last months our primary focus has been around extending support for Metrics, Traces and improving performance, among many others.

This release is smaller and focussed on improvements. 

- Fixes:

   - This patch implements a new configuration property called net.max_worker_connections that can be used in the output plugins sections, so Fluent Bit plugin, per worker, won't open more than net.max_worker_connections if it has been set. If the limit is reached, the output plugins will issue a retry.
   [PR](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/pull/7586)
   - Fixes #7574 setting Chocolatey version to 1.4.0 since the version doesn't require .NET 4.8, also ensures the host version matches the container version.[GH Link](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/7574)
